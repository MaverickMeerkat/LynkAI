In other words, from a business perspective, for each business entity it should be clear what we know of it, how was it defined, and where we can find it. We call these pieces of information on an entity level - . (#defining-entities)Defining EntitiesEntities can be defined either via code or via Lynk Studio UI.\\nThe below example shows how we define a customer entity as a YAML file:Copy# customer.yml\\n\\nname: customer\\n\\ndescription: a customer is a user who logged in at least once\\n\\nkey_table: db_prod.core.customer_dim\\n\\naliases:\\n- user\\n\\nfeatures:\\n\\n- type: metric\\n  name: orders_count\\n  asset: db_prod.core.orders\\n  measure: orders_count\\n  filters: null\\n  \\nrelated_assets:\\n\\n  db_prod.core.orders:\\n    relationship: one_to_many\\n    joins:\\n    - name: all_orders\\n      default: true\\n      type: sql\\n      sql: \"{source}.{customer_id} = {destination}.{customer_id}\"\\n (#key_table)key_tableAn entities is defined by it\\'s key data asset.\\nAn entity key data asset is a table or a view in the data warehouse, that has all the entity instances, and each entity instance exists only once on this asset.For example, if our entity is customer, it\\'s key data asset should have all the customers, and each customer appears only once in that data asset.The entity DIM table is a good fit here, if exists in the DWH.\\nHowever, any data asset which answers the the above requirement can fit. Once loaded as an entity in Lynk, you will be able to add as many enrichment features as needed. (#aliases)aliasesSometimes different people might call the same entity by different names. e.g a customer can also be referred to as a user. This is relevant especially when interacting with AI apps to ask questions. Lynk supports aliases to entity names.

See  page for in depth information on this.Define which Data Assets are related to the entity. Related assets will be shown and used when creating new features for an entity. For example, if the data asset db_prod.core.orders is related to the entity customer, we will be able to extract features from db_prod.core.orders to the customer level.

It is commonly used to enrich an entity with more complex calculations that require multiple aggregations or calculations to be done first. (#simple-formula-feature)Simple formula featureIn this example, we define simple metric features for the entity customer:Copy# customer.yml\\nfeatures:\\n  \\n- type: formula\\n  name: is_active_customer\\n  data_type: boolean\\n  sql: IFF(({last_login_date} > date_add('day', -30, current_date())) and {total_orders} > 100, true, false)On this example, we already have two features on the customer level: last_login_date and total_orders. We use these two features to define which customers are active customers.formula is a special type of feature, which is not reliant on related data assets or related entities like other feature types, as it creates features based on features of the same entity. (#type)typeThe feature type.\\nIn case of formula features, it should be set to formula. (#name)nameGive the feature a name. (#data_type-optional)data_type [optional]Specify the feature data type.\\nIf no data_type specified, Lynk will assume the data type is string.The options for data types are:stringFor any type of string data typenumberFor any type of number data type. For example: integer, float, decimal etc..boolFor boolean data type.datetimeFor any type of time-based data type. For example: date, timestamp, datetime etc.. (#sql)sqlThe formula definition.Any SQL code applies here as long as:It is based on features already defined on the entityit does not have aggregate functionsReferencing a feature in the SQL is done by using {FEATURE_NAME}In case you have an aggregate function in a formula, you probably need to create another metric feature and then create the formula feature on top of itPreviousFirst-Last (/reference/data-modeling/features/first-last)NextChaining features (/reference/data-modeling/chaining-features)Last updated 18 days ago\"]"
